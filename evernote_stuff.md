# Leadership in Collaborative Environments
**How running a coworking space teached me how to govern a flat organisation**

First of all: there is no standard solution. There never is. Every set of people is unique as well as its culture shared values and beliefs. The challenge is to figure out how to build a collective equilibrium in which ideas can grow, collaboration is strong and everybody is happy

My name is Christoph Fahle and I am one of 6 cofounders of betahaus, Europe's most famous coworking space situated in Berlin, Germany.  Today I want to share with you some of the insights I won during 5 years of operating a space that is home to over 250 Startups, Freelancers and Makers. We provide workspace, education and a professional community to the creative class. 

I still remember quite well our first weeks of operations. How it all started. it was then when we unintentionally layed out the basic principles of our working culture. In the early days we were a hobby-project and every task was fullfilled by that one person who was motivated most to do so. Everything that was not inspiring enough just was left over and eier skipped or done collectively. Apart from meeting a couple of times we basically had no other structure than this. Plans were made only 1-2 weeks in advance. Today I still remeber that time as something that was very close to ART and free expression of yourself. Doing what you want as a collective can lead to pretty interesting dynamic and colloaborative social sculptures. I often felt that we were like a very practial piece of ART like some kind of social installation with its benefits to the all pieces involved. 

Well, apparantly there was a time when suddenly things started to get a little more complicated. It was in the third or forth month when we had to contract service providers for stuff that nobody wanted to do anymore like cleaning or opening doors to coworkers at 8am sharp.

What's weird with coworker personalities is that  everybody is unique in his abilities and requirements to perform. I came across people that were perfect in a leaderless sourrounding  and others who needed strong guidance and authority . I finally concluded there is no such general rule for government or collaboration. It's more about an ecosystem that needs to find its balance as a whole. Culture is an important factor though and if there is a culture already there are people who don't fit that culture and hence have to leave earlier or late. Culture can change over time as well and leave people behind. 


What I find interesting is the difference between founders and employees that basically is difficult to deal with both for the founders and for the employees. Just a couple of weeks ago I realized when all of my cofounders were away and I was the only one left with the team that it was much more relaxed for everyone. I felt that the whole team was working together more balanced and emotionally chilled. I tried to find out an apparently it was calming them down to be confronted with the expectation of only one founder instead of facing three different ones that sometimes even are controversial to each other
