# Article on Leadership
I wanted to try out github and markdown for writing. This article on leaderhip is my excercise. 


##Tools
I use
- Sublime Text 2
- Markdown Plugin (forgot the exact name, there are some)
- Wordcount Plugin
- Markdown Preview Plugin (for the exact name, check out google. Will update this later)
